# Omakub
# This fork is for my personal use only 
# (1. Omit Signal37 apps from installation)
# for Ubuntu 24.04 on Frmaework Laptop 13 (Intel 11th Gen CPU)

Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
